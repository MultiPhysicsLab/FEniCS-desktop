### About [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)

FEniCS is a computing platform for partial differential equations
(PDE). FEniCS enables users to quickly translate scientific models
into efficient finite element code. With the high-level Python and C++
interfaces to FEniCS, it is easy to get started, but FEniCS offers
also powerful capabilities for more experienced programmers. FEniCS
runs on a multitude of platforms ranging from laptops to
high-performance clusters.
